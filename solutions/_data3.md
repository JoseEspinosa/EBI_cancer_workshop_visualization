the chromosomes names are different.  


In fact I converted the result from b37 to hg19 format. this not an issue while you focusing in the main chormosomes.  For these chormosome the corrdinate are the same. The main differences are in the unplaced contigs and in the mithochondria.  


I did this modification because circularize as many other tools does not support yet the b37 format due to his use of UCSC data.
