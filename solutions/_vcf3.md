Actually no.

we can try to cluster based and the number of somatic mutation as, it is well accepted that different cancer could lead to different level of mutation burden.

In that case S01, S04, S05 and  S06 would be clustered togther with high burden and S02, S03, S07 would be clustered as low burden.

We would see later if this early prediction is accurate.
