The 3 samples in the cluster S03, S04 and S06 seems to be driven by the signature 3 which confirm our previous results. This signature is known to be related with BRACA1/2 mutations. These 3 samples are form the same type of cancer (Kidney)

The 3 other samples seems to be driven by signatures S1A and S1B (Age) and S6 (DNA MMR deficiency). These are the same type of cancer (Colorectal) and this corespond to previous results of colorectal cancer signature. Sample S02 and S05 are very close to one of each other as shown by the heatmap. In fact these 2 samples represnt 2 differents metastasis sites from the same sample. 

The use of the 2 approaches (exploratory and identification) is a good compromise for clustering and signature identification. Better results will be found by using more samples and more complex methods such as those using Machine learning.
